                dossier. Once the dossier is ready for review, reviewers are notified via an automated email that the 
                case is ready. Reviewers are given access permissions according to their eligibility to view particular 
                types of cases. After logging in, reviewers and staff see a list of all e-dossiers they are eligible to view.</p>

                <p>After logging in, reviewers will see a "Reviews" tab on the right hand side of the page. Reviewers should

        Certain individuals are responsible for routing a candidate's e-dossier to the next level of review. These 
        individuals are referred to as <strong>"Principals"</strong> in the process and include the department chair, school 
        committee chair, dean, campus committee chair, vice provost/chancellor, provost/chancellor. </p>

             <ol type="A" >
                <li><strong>Routing Requirements:</strong></li>
                <p>For "Principals" responsible for routing the dossier to the next level, the system requires that the 
                internal evaluative letter must be uploaded and vote recorded. Once the requirements have been fulfilled, 
                a "route" button appears on the candidate dossier page allowing the principal to route the dossier to 
                the next level of review.</p>
                <p>To complete a vote record, click on the Vote Record link below the candidate's dossier on the left-hand 
                menu pane. Enter the numbers manually by clicking inside of each box of the record. Upload Evaluative 
                letters to the Internal Review folder. <br />

                <p>Individuals responsible for routing (and thus uploading the internal evaluative letter and recording the vote) 
                may assign a delegate (e.g., staff support) to assist in the process. Steps to "Assign a Reviewer Delegate"</p>
               <ol>
               		<li>Click "Assign a Chair Delegate" link, located at the top of the left-hand menu pane.</li>
               		<li>Enter the "IU Username" of the delegate and click the "search" button.</li>
               		<li>The name of the person should show upon the "Name" field.</li>
               		<li>If desired, you can enter a "Start and End Date". With or without start/end dates, click the 
               		"save" button to establish your delegate until you remove/delete them.</li>
               		<li>To delete delegate access, click the delete button under the "Action" column to remove their access.</li>

                <li><strong>Dealing with Candidate Supplemental Materials: </strong> </li>
                <p>A candidate may add materials to their dossier at any time during the review process. Once the dossier 
                is submitted and has been routed, a supplemental folder is automatically created for this purpose. Any 
                materials added to this folder are date and time-stamped.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Every time supplemental materials are submitted, workflow notifications are sent as a function of 
                "where" the e-dossier currently is in the review process . Principals are responsible for considering 
                these materials and, if applicable, informing others at their level (e.g., a department chair informing 
                departmental eligible faculty reviewers) of new materials. Principals are also responsible for 
                acknowledging consideration of new materials. Notifications are as follows:
               	</p>
               	<br />
               	<ul>
               		<li>The <strong>Principal</strong> at the current level of review receives essentially an 'fyi' notification: "You are 
               		being informed that Candidate X, whose e-dossier is currently under review at your level, has 
               		added material(s) to the supplemental folder. [Please notify others at your level (i.e. committee 
               		members) of these materials.] No other action is required.</li>
               		<br />
               		<li>For a past level of review (where a vote has already been recorded and letter uploaded), the 
               		<strong>Principal</strong> receives the following notification: "Candidate X, for whom you have already voted on, 
               		has added material(s) to their supplemental folder. Please consider these materials [and notify 
               		others at your level (i.e. committee members) to do so as well]. </li>

               	<p>
	               	<u>After consideration</u> (individually or via committee), the <strong>Principal</strong> will acknowledge the 
	               	supplemental materials in 1 of 2 ways : 
	               	<ul>
	               		<li>Choosing Acknowledge means that upon consideration, no further action will be taken.</li>
	               		<li>Choosing Acknowledge with Action means that upon consideration, a formal response 
	               		(i.e., a letter and possible revote) will be uploaded.</li>
