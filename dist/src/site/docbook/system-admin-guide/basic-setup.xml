			<para>
                The Earn Code maintenance page is used to define codes to categorize employee’s hours/earnings and time off.  For each earn code, you can define 
                how the employees records - in/out time, hours, days or flat dollar amount.  These codes may or may not be attached to an accrual category for
				tracking leave against available balances or simple reporting.  Most earn code attributes are defined in the payroll system, but there are a few 
				codes which need to be modified on the timesheet prior to the data being extracted to payroll.  An inflation factor and inflate minimum hours 
				value are definable on the earn code document.  These actions occur on the recorded hours in the timesheet and therefore would NOT need to be 
				done in the payroll system.  Additionally there are numerous flags on the earn code to limit availability and determine eligibility for accrual 
				and scheduling leave.

                                This field allows earn codes to be associated with another for payroll extract.  For example, you could associate all the Sick 
                                codes with the regular sick earn code and not extract the detail into your payroll system. (Sick family leave, sick injury, etc.

                                will require a hours amount, the Days earn code will require a days amount, and the Amount earn code will require a dollar

							<entry>Inflate Min Hours</entry>
							<entry>
                                Hours incurred will be inflated to this minimum hours value.  For example, Call Back Time rules specify the employee earns a
								minimum number of hours, regardless of the time worked. Set an inflate minimum hours on the earn code and the employee will see
								the number of hours correctly on the timesheet, instead of assuming it will be inflated later.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Inflate Factor</entry>
							<entry>
                                The hours incurred will be multiplied by this factor. For example, Compensatory Time Earned (in lieu of overtime) is earned at
								a factor of 1.5. When the employee earns comp time, this setting will inflate the hours by a factor of 1.5 and all hours shown 
								on the timesheet will be the inflated value. The employee will know the exact number of hours earned.
