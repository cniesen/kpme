			<title>Earn Code</title>
			<para>
                The Earn Code maintenance page is used to define codes to categorize employee’s hours/earnings and time off.  For each earn code, you can define 
                how the employees records - in/out time, hours, days or flat dollar amount.  These codes may or may not be attached to an accrual category for
				tracking leave against available balances or simple reporting.  Most earn code attributes are defined in the payroll system, but there are a few 
				codes which need to be modified on the timesheet prior to the data being extracted to payroll.  An inflation factor and inflate minimum hours 
				value are definable on the earn code document.  These actions occur on the recorded hours in the timesheet and therefore would NOT need to be 
				done in the payroll system.  Additionally there are numerous flags on the earn code to limit availability and determine eligibility for accrual 
				and scheduling leave.

				The system supports multiple pay cycles that are definable by start date/time and end date/time.  This allows for institutions to define 
				multiple pay and leave calendars such as monthly, semi-monthly, biweekly, or weekly. For example, an institution may define a pay period 
				beginning at Noon on a Thursday which runs 2 weeks to Noon the following Thursday.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Timekeeping and Leave Managements modules must allow for institutions to define calendars for which employees will report their time and 
				leave. These calendars may or  may not correspond to payroll calendars.  For example, institutions may choose to define leave reporting 
				calendars to be from the 15th of the month to the 15th of the following month while the payroll calendar may be from the 1st of the month to the 
				1st of the next month for the same employee.
			</para>

    	<para>Pay Type, similar to Pay Step, defines a classification of position / job used to divide groups of employees, however does so according to payroll attributes.
    		This attribute will also be associated with an employees job and is further used when defining rules such as Daily Overtime. Pay Type will likely be defined
    		off of an existing payroll attribute and created at implementation time to designate different rules for different populations of employees.</para>
